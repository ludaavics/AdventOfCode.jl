She sounded pretty worried when she called you down here. &quot;At 500-year intervals into the past, someone has been changing Santa&#39;s history!&quot;</p><p>&quot;The good news is that the changes won&#39;t propagate to our time stream for another 25 days, and we have a device&quot; - she attaches something to your wrist - &quot;that will let you fix the changes with no such propagation delay. It&#39;s configured to send you 500 years further into the past every few days; that was the best we could do on such short notice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The bad news is that we are detecting roughly fifty anomalies throughout time; the device will indicate fixed anomalies with stars. The other bad news is that we only have one device and you&#39;re the best person for the job! Good lu–&quot; She taps a button on the device and you suddenly feel like you&#39;re falling. To save Christmas, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.</p><p>Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!</p><p>After feeling like you&#39;ve been falling for a few minutes, you look at the device&#39;s tiny screen. &quot;Error: Device must be calibrated before first use. Frequency drift detected. Cannot maintain destination lock.&quot; Below the message, the device shows a sequence of changes in frequency (your puzzle input). A value like +6 means the current frequency increases by 6; a value like -3 means the current frequency decreases by 3.</p><p>For example, if the device displays frequency changes of +1, -2, +3, +1, then starting from a frequency of zero, the following changes would occur:</p><ul><li>Current frequency  0, change of +1; resulting frequency  1.</li><li>Current frequency  1, change of -2; resulting frequency -1.</li><li>Current frequency -1, change of +3; resulting frequency  2.</li><li>Current frequency  2, change of +1; resulting frequency  3.</li></ul><p>In this example, the resulting frequency is 3.</p><p>Here are other example situations:</p><ul><li>+1, +1, +1 results in  3</li><li>+1, +1, -2 results in  0</li><li>-1, -2, -3 results in -6</li></ul><p>Starting with a frequency of zero, what is the resulting frequency after all of the changes in frequency have been applied?</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Part-One-Solution-1" href="#Part-One-Solution-1">Part One Solution</a></h2><p>Iunno.</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Part-Two-1" href="#Part-Two-1">Part Two</a></h2><p>You notice that the device repeats the same frequency change list over and over. To calibrate the device, you need to find the first frequency it reaches twice.</p><p>For example, using the same list of changes above, the device would loop as follows:</p><ul><li>Current frequency  1, change of -2; resulting frequency -1.</li><li>Current frequency -1, change of +3; resulting frequency  2.</li><li>Current frequency  2, change of +1; resulting frequency  3.</li><li>(At this point, the device continues from the start of the list.)</li><li>Current frequency  3, change of +1; resulting frequency  4.</li><li>Current frequency  4, change of -2; resulting frequency  2, which has already been seen.</li></ul><p>In this example, the first frequency reached twice is 2. Note that your device might need to repeat its list of frequency changes many times before a duplicate frequency is found, and that duplicates might be found while in the middle of processing the list.</p><p>Here are other examples:</p><ul><li>+1, -1 first reaches 0 twice.</li><li>+3, +3, +4, -2, -4 first reaches 10 twice.</li><li>-6, +3, +8, +5, -6 first reaches 5 twice.</li><li>+7, +7, -2, -7, -4 first reaches 14 twice.</li></ul><p>What is the first frequency your device reaches twice?</p><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Part-Two-Solution-1" href="#Part-Two-Solution-1">Part Two Solution</a></h2><p>Still don&#39;t know.</p><footer><hr/><a class="previous" href="../../"><span class="direction">Previous</span><span class="title">Home</span></a><a class="next" href="../day02/"><span class="direction">Next</span><span class="title">Day 2</span></a></footer></article></body></html>
