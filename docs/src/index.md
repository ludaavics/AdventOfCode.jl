# Julia Advent Of Code

_Using the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) as an excuse to (finally) learn [Julia](https://julialang.org)._


## Usage

  * How to run the solutions, presumably from command line.
  * How to fetch your own inputs (-> learn http queries etc)
  * ...

## Tools

 - [Example.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl): project structure template.
 - [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl): documentation generator.

## Disclaimer

I may present solutions that I've found elsewhere on the web (with proper attribution, of course): while I certainly enjoy the puzzle-solving aspect, my primary goal is to get my hands dirty in Julia, and build a cheat-sheet repo for future projects.
